      Welcome to MemoryLane!
      </p>

      <p>
      Here is a walkthrough to the <strong>Memories</strong> system.
      </p>

      <p>
      First, you must be logged in to save and access your Memories.
      </p>

      <p>
      You can take pictures on the <strong>Camera</strong> tab to initialize a Memory.
      </p><p>
      Write a little something about that Memory! Photo, memory, and location are combined to form a Memory in our database.
      </p>

      <p>
      You can view these records on the Logs screen, where there is a scrollable map displaying the different locations.
      </p>
