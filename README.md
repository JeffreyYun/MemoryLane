# MemoryLane

**Places**. They are an integral part of our memories, a core element of many of our experiences. We oft yearn to share just what a place means to us.

**Memory Lane** is an awesome new app that allows you to record memories associated with a specific location. You can choose to make them private or public, viewable by others, who can share in your nostalgia.

**Memory Lane** seeks to bring individuals together through shared experiences in shared places. Perhaps two individuals could resonate over some memory. Perhaps the collective significance of a place may increase through wider and deeper experiential records.
